        <p> I am a student at the University of California, Los Angeles. I am an avid reader, equally interested in science, social sciences, and literature. I believe in self learning as there is no dearth of knowledge in this age of internet. An extrovert, I enjoy interacting with people from different cultures, age groups and social strata. In my free time, I am sweating it out on the badminton court, devouring political/crime dramas, painting canvases, or just practicing her Oscar acceptance speech. <br><br> <i>Highlight of the Summer: Tried to read all the books on the week's New York Times Bestsellers List </i> </p>
